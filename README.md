# CS-106B
Homework and tests for CS-106B

I'm using Stanford Everywhere for video lectures (http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx -> CS106B),
and Stanford's current course offering webpage (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/) for course reader, slides,
and programming assignments, due to compatibility issues with the stanford libraries / visual studio in the SEE version.
